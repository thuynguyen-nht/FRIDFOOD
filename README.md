# Project2

FRIDFOOD!! An app that turns whats in your fridge to food.

## Objective

Users will be able to search for recipes based on (a) ingredient(s) they have in hand, and will show them the steps once selected

They will also be able to store what is currently in their fridge to easily find recipes and they can save recipes

Each user can potentially log in and save the inventory of their fridge. Making a recipe will manipulate their inventory in the database and keep records of what is in their fridge.

## Motive

With people being stuck in their homes during SIP, learning to find quick recipes with items you have readily available could prove useful. Time to get creative with what is in your fridge and pantry!
