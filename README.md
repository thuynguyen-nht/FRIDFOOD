## Objective		
Users will be able to search for recipes based on (a) ingredient(s) they have in hand, and will show them the steps once selected		

They will also be able to store what is currently in their fridge to easily find recipes and they can save recipes		

Each user can potentially log in and save the inventory of their fridge. Making a recipe will manipulate their inventory in the database and keep records of what is in their fridge.
