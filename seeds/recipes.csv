5;"Sesame Clementine & Cabbage Salad";"Make the dressing: whisk together taste and adjust seasonings.Make the tofu: Slice your tofu and gently pat it with a clean towel to dab up some of the excess water.In an 8x8 square baking pan (with edges) mix together the soy sauce rice vinegar and sesame oil. Place the tofu slabs into the pan and flip them so you coat both sides. Set aside and let it marinate while you finish everything else (15-20 minutes or so). After it's marinated sprinkle both sides of each with some sesame seeds and some panko bread crumbs. Heat a large skillet with some olive oil. When the oil is hot cook tofu for 2-3 minutes per side. Let cool to room temp and chop into small cubes for the salad.Fry the shallots: After you slice your shallots pat them dry with a clean towel. Toss shallots in a bit of flour. Heat a medium skillet with about inch of oil. When the oil is hot drop one slice in. If it bubbles you're ready to toss in the rest. If it burns turn the heat down on your oil and test another. Fry the shallots for about 7-8 seconds each remove and place on a plate with a paper towel to dry.Assemble the salad: Toss everything (except the fried shallots and tofu) together with most of the dressing. This one is best if you let it sit in the fridge for 10 minutes or so before serving. Taste & adjust adding more dressing and adjusting seasonings to your liking. Top with the chopped tofu and crispy fried shallots.";446461;"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/446461-556x370.jpg,";"2018-11-27 19:48:42";"2018-11-27 19:48:42"
6;"Chicken Liver Pâté";"Trim all fat and connecting tissue from chicken livers. Place cleaned livers in a small bowl and cover with the milk. Place in the refrigerator for two hours.Place soaked livers in a strainer and strain and discard liquid.In a large saut pan over medium heat melt butter and add shallots thyme salt and pepper. Saut until shallots are tender about 4-5 minutes and do not brown.Turn burner to medium high to high heat and add livers and cognac. Cook for about five minutes until cooked but still slightly pink inside. Since the livers I used were different sizes I pulled the smaller ones out after about four minutes and let the bigger ones continue to cook so that none of the livers overcooked. This is important to not overcook them as they will get tough and rubbery. But it is equally as important to cook them over a somewhat high heat so that they brown. At the end of the five minutes any liquid should have evaporated. If not remove cooked livers and cook liquid a minute or so longer to evaporate. Set the pan and cooked liver aside to cool slightly.Once cool enough to handle place the cooked livers and the contents of the pan into a blender. Add all of the chicken fat and 3 tablespoons of heavy cream and puree until fine. Use the last tablespoon of cream if necessary to yield a creamy texture. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed.Pour into a serving container cover tightly with plastic wrap so that the wrap touches the top of the pate tight. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight.Serve with crackers (we found rice crackers to be the best) and cornichons which are tart little mini pickles and often served with pt.Keeps well up to five days refrigerated but over time the pt will begin to turn grey where it has been exposed to air. This change in color does not alter the taste at all.";701668;"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/701668-556x370.jpg,";"2018-11-27 19:49:24";"2018-11-27 19:49:24"
